# Analysing the ATLAS open datasets

### Instructions to get set-up:
The binder contains a collection of simple python notebooks to analyse the ATLAS Open Data datasets.

Click on the link below titled "launch binder" to access the code.

 - Note if it's the first time running, it may take up to 15 minutes to load and build the environment.

### Optional:
Rather than using the GitHub browser to read and edit code, you can also make a local copy of your fork. This way you can edit the code locally (useful if you have an unstable internet connection for example), push your changes to your fork, and then return to this page to load the binder and run the code.
